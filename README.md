# First-betting-app

Python

Originaly going to use Odds API, but decided to make my own scraper for sportsbet with Beautiful soup.
Features:

- slow
- can only read static html (need to upgrade)
- save results data (place odds, win odds, name, position, race) as json

Defualt config: save todays resulted races as json (with test_2). Can append to csv (probably need to manually input json file name)
